Raw data for ESIN FTICR-MS analysis of BFWs-Scale Formation from Dissolved Organic Matter in SAGD Steam Generators- Part I: Acidic Species Characterized by FTICR-MS
# The provided Excel file contains identified chemical formulas by ESIN FTICR-MS in boiler feed waters (BFWs) and heated BFWs from different geological locations in Alberta, Canada.
# These samples were collected during 2020 and 2021 and were analyzed from 2020 to 2024.
#The sheet name serves as an ID for each BFW, and the heated ones contain the BFW's ID plus "16".
